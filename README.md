(April 2023) : Hai, just call me Hafizh. By the way, this is my first landing page. So, I just make as simple as I want.
It,s just contain 2 files as you can see. I'm using Bootstrap 5.2, at least to make my landing page just more looking good.
I plan to put all my college's projects and task which I feel worthy in my GitHub. Then, I linked it into my landing page.
However, I want to upgrade this page using React in the future. Thank's for coming!

(December 2023) : It's been a long time since I update my Landing Page. Now, I have learnt tailwind and react. But, I have not
try deploy react on github.io. So, this upate is just upgrading CSS framework from Bootstrap into Tailwind. Also, maybe 
deploying my landing page into github.io using react is my next target.
